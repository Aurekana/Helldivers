THANK YOU FOR BUYING MY FILES!

This gun is the ultimate democracy dispenser.

This gun was a ton of fun to design and build.

I have designed this to have a functioning bolt, trigger and magazine.

for hardware it needs:
	-(12) 6x3 mm magnets
	-(1) M3 x 20 mm (this is to hold the spring in, any rod that could hold the spring works)
	-(1) 9/32"x2" extension spring
	-(2) 7/32"x11/16" compresion spring
	-(1) 1/2" dowel roughly 22" long

ASSEMBLY

Assembly is pretty straightforward, with inserting the dowel in the given hole and trimming as needed. 
Use glue inbetween seams and sand as needed to ensure a good seam.

to insert the bolt carrier, slide the spring inbetween the 'tongs' and onto the peg, slide the 9/32"x2" extension spring side forward into the center segment. when the spring and carrier are inserted, then insert the screw into the screw hole that is on top of the gun in the magwell. Be careful not to overextend the spring as the bolt doesn't have a stopper until the rear segment is installed.

For the trigger assembly, insert the two 7/32"x11/16" compresion spring into their respective holes on the trigger, the springs fit over the nubs inside the grip and trigger guard. 

when installing the center segment to the back, just before they meet install the trigger and grip.

For the magazine just make sure to get the magnets polarity correct.



If you need any references on how its assembled there are renders and exploded view on the sale page.
Let me know if you have any issues, email or comment is great!
